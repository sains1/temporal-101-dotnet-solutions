# \*Unofficial\* Temporal 101 dotnet code solutions

This repo contains my \*unofficial\* code solutions when following the temporal 101 typescript course.

At the time of writing no dotnet course exists (as its still in alpha). I've ported this course as a learning exercise, but to the best of my knowledge it's correct.
