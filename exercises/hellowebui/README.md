# Exercise 2: Hello Web UI

This readme was ported from the official typescript tutorial [hello-web-ui/README.md](https://github.com/temporalio/edu-101-typescript-code/blob/main/exercises/hello-web-ui/README.md).

> Note - When using the temporal-cli, the WebUI will be available at `http://localhost:8233/`

During this exercise, you will:

- Use the Temporal Web UI to display the list of recent Workflow Executions. The exercise environment is configured to open the Web UI automatically, and look for the tab with the label "Simple Browser" or run the command `webui`.
- View the detail page for the Workflow Execution from the previous exercise
- See if you can find the following information on the detail page:
  - Name of the task queue
  - Start time
  - Close time (this is the time of completion)
  - Input and output for this Workflow execution (hint: click the `</> Input and Results` section)
